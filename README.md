This script assumes that the Binance CSV file has the following columns:

    Date: The date of the trade
    Type: The type of trade (TRADE or MARGIN_TRADE)
    Coin: The name of the coin involved in the trade
    Amount: The amount of the coin traded
    Price: The price of the trade

The script converts the Binance trade type to the corresponding German tax category (Spekulationsgeschäft for TRADE and Termingeschäft for MARGIN_TRADE) and calculates the trade amount in Euros. It then creates a list of dictionaries with the necessary information for the tax report, and writes it to an output file in CSV format.
